# Airbnb Clone

This is a simplified clone of Airbnb, built using MongoDB, Express, and Node.js. It allows users to search for listings, view detailed information about listings, and make reservations.

## Technologies Used

### MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. This flexibility allows for rapid development and iteration.

### Express
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node.js-based web applications, providing a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that developers know and love.

### Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side code, enabling full-stack JavaScript applications. Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
